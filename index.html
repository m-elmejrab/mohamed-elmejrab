            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Production Manager<br><br>
            <strong>Description:</strong> "Marionette" is a powerful Libyan drama series that delves into themes of power, loyalty, and moral ambiguity in a nation struggling with its future. The story follows Omar, the elusive leader of a powerful underground network, as he challenges the status quo and sparks conflict with the ruling government.<br><br>
			As Production Manager, I oversaw the entire production process of the 10-episode series, leading a team of over 55 cast and crew members. Despite the logistical and security complexities of filming in Libya, I successfully delivered the full series on time and within budget, completing principal photography in just 42 days.

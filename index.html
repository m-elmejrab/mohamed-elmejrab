    <div class="bio">
        <div class="text-content">
            <p align="justify">Mohamed Elmejrab is a creative professional working across TV production, post-production, and game development. With a focus on meaningful, engaging content, he has contributed to a range of Libyan media and game projects that reached wide audiences and sparked positive conversations.
			<br><br>
			As a Production Manager, Mohamed led the production of Marionette, a Libyan TV drama broadcast on Libya Al-Ahrar TV. He managed a cast and crew of over 55 people and successfully delivered all 10 episodes on time and within budget. The series was watched by millions both on television and online. He also managed the award-winning COVID-19 awareness video A New Reality, which won RNW Media’s Best COVID-19 Awareness Video award in 2020, bringing together healthcare workers and citizens in a powerful call to action.
			<br><br>
			As a Colorist, Mohamed worked on Masaha, a unique talk show promoting social dialogue, and Alash?! Studio, a bold program tackling Libya's most sensitive public issues. He created a unified visual identity for both shows, balancing footage to achieve a consistent, professional look that matched each show's tone and message. Both series resonated widely with Libyan viewers and sparked meaningful discussions.
			<br><br>
			In game development, Mohamed served as Lead Developer on several notable projects. Tra Tani – Show Me Again, a puzzle game promoting the work of 24 Libyan youth artists, became the most downloaded Libyan-developed game to date. He also led the development of ASTRU, a physics-based mobile puzzle game inspired by cosmology, and Irty – My Heritage, an educational demo helping children explore Libyan history and culture through fun quizzes and interactive exploration. Across these projects, he programmed gameplay mechanics, physics, UI, and much more.
			<br><br>
			Currently, Mohamed is exploring the future of live music in digital spaces through his PhD research at the University for the Creative Arts. His work investigates how gamifying VR concerts affects the audience's experience. Mohamed’s research develops and tests different levels of gamification, aiming to uncover how these interactive elements influence audience engagement. His findings will help inform musicians, game designers, and record labels on how to design meaningful digital concert experiences in a rapidly changing industry.
